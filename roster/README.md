# Project Roster (starleaf.online.static)

Derived from .github/.claude agent patterns in the repo.

## Phases (deterministic)
1) Foundation: Astro + TypeScript
2) Quality: Code review + dependency audit
3) Docs: README/Release notes

## Outputs
Each role writes to the standard run packet outputs. Approval requires all outputs + FINAL.md and a fully checked checklist.
